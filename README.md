# Google Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a **Google Stock Price Prediction** model using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to predict stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable insights for traders and financial analysts.

## Features
- Uses historical Google stock price data for training.
- Implements feature engineering and data preprocessing.
- Applies LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for time-series forecasting.
- Visualizes predictions against actual stock prices for evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical stock prices for Google, including features such as:
- Open Price
- High Price
- Low Price
- Close Price
- Volume

### Dataset Format
Ensure your dataset is in `.csv` format with the following columns:
```csv
Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
```

## Usage
### 1. Run the Notebook
Open the **Google Stock Price Prediction** notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab:
- **Google Colab**: [Run the Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- **Local Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook google_stock_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

### 2. Train the Model
The notebook walks you through:
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Feature scaling and splitting.
- Training the LSTM model.
- Visualizing predictions.

### 3. Evaluate the Model
The notebook generates the following outputs:
- Predicted vs actual stock price visualization.
- Model evaluation metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

### 4. Customize
You can modify hyperparameters such as:
- **Sequence Length**: Number of days used for prediction.
- **LSTM Units**: Number of neurons in the LSTM layer.
- **Batch Size** and **Epochs**.

## Code Structure
- `google_stock_price_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `data/`: Folder for storing datasets (to be added by the user).

## Key Components
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Feature selection and scaling.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
2. **LSTM Model**
   - Sequential model with LSTM layers.
   - Optimized for time-series prediction.
3. **Visualization**
   - Matplotlib plots to compare predicted vs actual prices.

## Results
- **Prediction Accuracy**: 97
- **Model Performance**: 96

## Future Work
- Integrate external features (e.g., news sentiment, market indices).
- Optimize hyperparameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization.
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.
